Hylang - gradient descent
=========================
*Hylang - gradient descent* is a basic neural network (gradient descent) as presented by Siraj Raval in `this YouTube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3l4qz76JhQ>`__.
It's implemented in `Hy <http://docs.hylang.org/>`__, a Lisp dialect for the Python ecosystem.

Setup
-----
I recommend using *Hylang - gradient descent* in a Python `virtual environment <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`__.
Install the requirements by running ``pip install -r requirements``.

Start the program by executing ``run.py``:

::

    Python run.py

Play around with the parameters and program logic by adjusting them directly in the main source file, `gradient_descent.hy <./gradient_descent.hy>`__.
